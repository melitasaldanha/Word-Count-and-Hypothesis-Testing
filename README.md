## Objective:
Find significant associations between words and ratings by using multi-test corrected hypothesis testing. Your objective is to compute the correlation between each of the 1,000 most common words (case insensitive) across all reviews with the rating score for the reviews, controlling for whether the review was verified or not using Tensorflow.
